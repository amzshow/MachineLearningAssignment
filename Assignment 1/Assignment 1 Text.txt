You need to code the gradient descent algorithm for linear regression. 

1. Start by creating a housing prices dataset with just one feature (area of the house) 
2. Initialize parameter values at random 
3. Set your alpha parameter 
4. Run gradient descent algorithm by updating theta values until the gradient becomes less than 0.01. 
5. Report the final values of theta that can be used to make predictions 
6. Bonus points if you make predictions on some test set as well (and compute MSE on it) 
7. Further bonus if you visualize the theta values changing over iterations. 

Push your code to github and submit the URL as this assignment.
